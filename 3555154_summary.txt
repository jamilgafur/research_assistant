In order to keep one’s computing systems and data secure, it is critical to be aware of how to effectively maintain security and privacy online. Prior experimental work has shown that social media are effective platforms for encouraging security-enhancing behavior. Through an analysis of historical social media logs containing almost 200,000 social media posts, we study the extent to which participants talked about security on social media platforms. We found that interactions with posts that feature content relevant to security and Privacy made up less than 0.09% of interactions we observed. Security and privacy-related posts on social media very rarely discussed constructively. Social networks may be effective in influencing security behavior, but there may not be enough substantial or useful discussions of security and privacy to encourage better security behavior in practice and on a larger scale. Our findings highlight the importance of increasing the prevalence of constructive security andPrivacy advice on online social media in order to encourge better security and Privacy behavior. The study was published in the journal Cybersecurity and Information Security (CIS). The number of dimensions across which security and privacy need to be maintained is growing. The current state of the digital world require widespread adoption of healthy security practices. The ACM urges users to be aware of their privacy and security when using social media sites and other online platforms.

Security and privacy awareness in general remains essential for people to keep their systems and data secure and private. Social media are some of the most prevalent environments for discussing security and privacy. Using a dataset of real-world Facebook and Twitter behavior, we examine in particular how prevalent the sharing of information about securityand privacy may be in practice. We also look at what information may typically convey, e.g., personal anecdotes and educational disbursements. We conclude that social media are effective platforms for encouraging friends to adopt security-enhancing behavior. Study looked at Facebook and Twitter logs of 38 participants who were enrolled in the Security BehaviorObservatory (SBO) SBO is a longitudinal study of computer security behaviors collected from participants’ home computers. We chose to collect and analyze data of SBO participants because the SBO allows us to also analyze the security behaviors of participants by collecting browser and system usage logs. We use these security behaviors as part of an exploratory analysis of the relationship between interactions with security and privacy content on social media. Only 131 of the 194, 081 Facebook posts that participants interacted with, and 44 of the 6, 883 Twitter posts, were related to security and privacy (0.09% in total) Of the 38 participants surveyed, almost half (47%) did not interact with any security or privacy content at all. The amount of interactions with security- and privacy-related posts was not correlated with demographic characteristics or with technical savviness. We discuss the limitations of the SBO dataset in Sec. 6. Only 0.08% of the posts were related to security and privacy. We examined these posts through a thematic analysis. One of these themes described posts that presented obviously constructive security and advice. Other themes were ambiguous about whether they were promoting desirable or undesirable security practices. Only 10% of participants interacted with such posts and not as often as with posts that demonstrated the other less constructive themes. The most clearly helpful theme may be the most helpful in encouraging desirable security practices, but only 10% interacted with it. Security and privacy were not topics that people frequently interacted with or were exposed to on social media. Given that our sample was slightly skewed towards technically-savvy and educated people, we suspect that the general population may have even less exposure to security and privacy than we observed.

Security- and privacy-related posts provided little to no useful commentary on security practices. Participants who interacted with the security and privacy posts we analyzed may have obtained higher security awareness, but are not likely to have taken actionable advice or adopted security-enhancing behaviors. Our findings suggest that without interventions, the amount of constructive security advice being shared could be too low to effectively e. f security-and-privacy posts we found in the random Twitter sample. The study was published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science. Achieving more widespread adoption of security best practices could potentially be helped by two broad steps: increasing the spread of security and privacy advice using wide-reaching channels such as social media. presenting the advice in such a way that user burden is reduced and such that it incites changes in their security behavior. We conclude with a discussion about how our findings inform future work in these directions, as well as a discussion on what could constitute effective security education as part of the disseminated advice. We discuss related work on the role of social influence inSecurity and privacy and the applications of social media as an educational to students. Prior work has repeatedly shown that social influence plays a role in the adoption of security-enhancing habits. Informal stories told by friends and family members were found to be significant sources of information and encouragement to advise others about security. Researchers also found that users were inclined to change their security behavior as a result of indirect group or peer pressure. When making security decisions, participants were more influenced to take defensive measures if they were told that several of their                friends made that decision as well. Similarly, users of a proposed filesystem implemented cybersecurity features when they were shown that other users had also done so. Social networks have been used to directly implement social influence to encourage different kinds of behavior. Studies that examine social influence within a social network introduced the concept of “social announcements,” which tell users how many other users in their network are using certain security features. Researchers found that these social announcements were correlated with increased adoption of security features and awareness. Disseminating information about security features through a socialnetwork increased the adoption of these features, but this adoption also depended on other factors, such as the perceived visibility of the feature. Social networks have served aseffective platforms for people to engage in discussions about security and privacy experiences, advice, and complaints. Prior work has shown that social influence is an effective tool for encouraging adoption of certain security-enhancing behaviors and decisions. However, such social influence has also been seen to have a negative effect on computer users’ security prac-                tices. Our paper measures—using empirical, real-world data—how social media may be being used as a platform to talk about security. Social media has been used as a purely educational tool for spreading awareness and education in areas not related to security and privacy. Research has shown that people often use social media for the purpose of absorbing new information, making social media as an educational tool particularly promising. In a similar vein, researchers have also found that social networks used for messaging such as WeChat can be used to increase awareness of wildlife conservation through social media posts [45]. For more information on how to use social networks to spread awareness, visit the Social Networking Project website. Social media has been extensively used in other areas for example, to launch mental health awareness campaigns [71] and to increase geographic awareness across the world. Other work has highlighted the issue that dissemination of scientific issues and perceptions should not solely rely on traditional scientific journals or legacy media to reach beyond the scientific community. The specific way that people use social media is also a determining factor in how issueawareness is spread [54]. Social media has also been extensively been used to spread awareness about issues such as security and privacy. We used data collected by the Security Behavior Observatory (SBO) project. The SBO is a longitudinal study of the usage patterns and security behaviors of Windows computer users. SBO participants’ home computers were instrumented with software that that was used to collect data. We used data from January 2015 upto April 2018. The Scarcity and Ambiguity of Security Advice on Social Media will be published in ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. The SBO project was approved by the ethics review board at its home institution. The data collection software collected data via system-level components and browser extensions in Chrome, MozillaFirefox, and Internet Explorer. We collected additional social media data from a subset of SBO participants through another study approved by  the relevant institutes. Participants were compensated by the SBO with $30 for enrolling and an additional $10 each month they were enrolled in the study. We also collected Facebook and Twitter data. We collected Facebook and Twitter data between January 2015 and April 2018. All Facebook posts are not visible or searchable to the public while Twitter posts created by non-private accounts are publicly available online. The logs we curated covered all historical social media activity (not including private messages) irrespective of the device on which participants may have used the application. In particular, the logs for a given Facebook or Twitter user contained posts made by the user and posts the user interacted with (e.g.,liked, commented on, saved, or re-shared) To protect participant anonymity, we only report the text of Facebook posts that are private to users or are made by public Facebook pages1. Participants who consented to thisadditional study received $15 compensation in the form of an Amazon gift card. We created developer applications for both Facebook and Twitter [30, 79] and asked participants to log into our applications through a webpage presented after the consent page to our additional study. Participants had the option to provide data for one or both platforms. We collected a participant’s Facebook data as follows: using the Facebook API, we fetched their login credentials, and we exclusively stored the MD5 hash of the name for subsequent use. We do no work directly working with the participant’s identifying information. We instrumented the SBO browser extension to trigger data collection when the participant logged into Facebook and visited the Facebook homepage from their SBO computer. For Twitter, we used the credentialiovasculartokens provided when participants logged into our Twitter app and used the Twitter API [79] to retrieve the above-mentioned Twitter data for each participant. If data collection was halted due to logging out, it was progressivelyresumed the next time the participant log in to Facebook. The study is based on the longitudinal data collected by the browser extensions and the additional social media data for 38 participants. 34 participants provided us with Facebook data, 16 with Twitter data, and 12 with both Facebook and Twitter data. The participants who provided Facebook data interacted with 5708 Facebook posts on average over the four-year period. They interacted with 601 tweets on average. Tables 5 and 6 in App. A.2 describe the number of posts for each type of inte. The study was published in ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2. Participants’ ages ranged from 21 to 81 years with a mean age of 33. Participants were female-skewed (74%) A little more than half (53%) knew at least one programming language. 61% were students and 53% had a bachelor’s degree or higher. We compiled a set of all the Facebook and Twitter posts the participants interacted with during the timeframe discussed in Sec. 3. We discuss limitations of our dataset (such as the small sample size) insec. 6. We extracted and concatenated all pieces of text corresponding to the components of the post. For example, if a post was being re-shared, we considered both the original text and the shared text. We identified posts related to computer or                online security and privacy by examining this text for each post. We then systematically built a list of regular expres-                sions (regexes) by reviewing all posts and by brainstorming for regexes related to digital security                and privacy. After constructing the final list of regexes, we flagged all the posts that matched any of the criteria. To ensure the absence of false positives, we manually examined all the flagged posts and unflagged them if they appeared not to match the criteria for security and privacy. We then added the new strings to the list of regexes and repeated the process again until we had a full list of all the matched posts. The result is a list of the most secure and privacy-related posts. Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. Publication date: November 2022. We verified that sampling 100 posts at the end of each iteration was sufficient to ensure no false negatives. We found that none of these 1000 postswere related to security and privacy, implying that our approach unlikely missed relevant posts. We used the above approach after exploring a few possibilities. Originally, one approach was toconstruct a topic model based on the text of individual, uncategorized posts. However, the resulting topic models were too complex to work with. We found 131 of the 194, 081 Facebook posts (0.07%) and 44 of the 6, 883 Twitter posts ( 0.6%) in our dataset to be related to security and privacy. To confirm that this proportion wasn’t an artifact of our dataset, we compared it to the proportion ofSecurity and privacy content in a dataset of 100 tweets made by each of 1000 randomly selected Twitter users from a public dataset. The resulting dataset contained 15, 040 tweets, as not all Twitter users had 100 tweets to collect. Based on the results for two different datasets, we find that security and privacy content wasscarcely interacted with on social media by the participants. Although “bitcoin” may not seem directly related to security and  privacy, it is in fact related. 8% of posts were flagged as 20% related to privacy and security. We found that they were correctly categorized as not related to safety and privacy. To ensure the absence of false negatives as a result of using the list of regular expressions for our collected data, we sampled 100 random unflagged tweets. In Section 4 we reported on the low occurrence of interactions with security- and privacy-related content in our set of Facebook and Twitter posts. In this section, we dive deeper into the posts by conducting a thematic analysis of the posts that the social network users interacted with. The purpose of this analysis is to characterize the types of security-centric content people may come across as they’re browsing social media. We considered it to be related because it is a digital currency thatagicallyprovides privacy protection for its users. Researchers familiarized themselves with every security- and privacy-related Facebook and Twitter post in our dataset. If a link was present in the post, we considered the link’s content as part of the post. Using an inductive approach, one of the researchers conducted a round of open coding of each post. Axial coding was then used to derive higher-level codes or categories related to what the post appeared to convey. Following this, the researcher identified a set of overarching themes across the identified higher- level categories. We identified five major themes in how the Facebook and Twitter posts mentioned security and privacy. Some posts mentioned a security or privacy topic but did not elaborate on that topic or that topic was not the focus of the post. Such posts also included announcements about something related to security andprivacy but without details of the actual phenomenon. We did not compute the inter-rater reliability between two coders, a decision that is supported by prior work [3, 5, 53]. The results are published in the open-access journal Cybersecurity. Of the 34 Facebook users and 16 Twitter users, 14 and five respectively interacted with posts responding to this theme. A total of 16 participants interact with posts in this theme across Facebook and Twitter. Some posts discussed security and privacy in more detail but did not convey a clear message of encouraging or d encouraging people to use the service. The following are examples of posts that exhibit this encompass theme. The terms “data privacy”, “bitcoin” and “cyber security” do not describe the main topic. Security posts were sometimes sarcastic, included anecdotes about security experiences, or joked about security topics. Some posts included the acronym ‘LOL’ (the acronym for ‘laughout loud’) which indicates that the poster thinks the idea of the right to privacy is funny. Other posts talked about passwords being too much but without explaining why they are “too much” or the security advantages and disadvantages of passwords. The posts were published in ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264, November 2022. A total of nine participants interacted with posts in this theme, encompassing eight Facebook users and three Twitter users. A less frequent type of post encourages constructive security or privacy advice. It could be by sharing an anecdote about how certain security practices helped them, criticizing poor security practices, or explicitly delivering constructiveadvice.

In the above post, the poster suggests how to tell if someone’s account was compromised as a result of phishing. Do not trust and open emails sent by their hacked account. Don’t download anything that is harmful to your computer, as it will be automatically removed on account of it being a virus. If you see a message that says ‘I’ve been hacked,’ it means you have been hacked and you need to change your password. If the message is not from a hacker, it means the account has been compromised. The wifi password is probably puravida Thank you Costa Rica.... I want WomanlyAlways1895 on my gravestone Lol does anyone know what the for sisterspassword on the chi o wix page is?. The password information was intended to be public or whether it was posted to a private group. The post demonstrates a bad practice of posting or asking for passwords online which may encourage the same behavior in others. A total of seven participants interacted with these negatively constructive posts, all of whom were Facebook users. The study was published in ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol 6, No. 6, Article 264.

Only 10 participants interacted with security and privacy posts. Such posts occurred infrequently (20% of the 175 security and. privacy posts and 0.02% of all social media posts in our dataset) We hypothesized that the discussions we observed about security andprivacy on Facebook and Twitter may not have been prevalent enough to trigger such an effect in the wild. We tested this hypothesis through an exploratory statistical a. between social media interactions and security behaviors. The results of the study were published in the open-access journal Security and Privacy. We computed 44 features representing social media interactions with posts related to technology, security and privacy, and data breaches. We identified posts in the latter two categories in a similar way as described in Sec. 4. A list of all features and their descriptions can be found in Table 8 in                App. nalysis. A. We computed 25 outcomes representing security behavior. Among the system events, the outcomes described the number of computer updates on participan. The outcomes spanned behaviors concerning a variety of system and browsing events. We built quantile regression models [48] to model the relationships between the above social media interactions and security behavior outcomes. We found no demographics or social media metrics to be consistently statistically significant. We conclude that interactions withsecurity and privacy content on these platforms, whether as a result of sharing or consuming, were not associated with improved security behavior. A list of all security behavior indicators along with their descriptions can be found in Table 9 in App. A.4 descr descr A. 4. We analyzed the data of a (relatively) small subset of participants in the SBO due to the difficulty of recruiting participants to agree to additional data collection. Popular social networks such as Facebook do not provide access to activity logs through their API. Our dataset is a tradeoff between a large number of participants (which it doesn’t have) and extensive, hard-to-obtain, longitudinal Facebook data. We ensured the lack of false positives by randomly sampling 100 posts in each iteration andsampling 1000 unmatched posts at the end. Even though we found no false negatives in th 53% of the 38 participants interacted with security and privacy posts. The majority of them only interacted with two or fewer posts. Only 29% interacted with more than two security- and privacy-related posts. Since these keywords and expressions were constructed based. on the above process whose effectiveness we validated, we believe that the posts that discussed.security and privacy discussed them using these specific terms. Although this corresponds to a low number of participants whose behavior we analyzed, this also substantiates our findings. The participants in our study were female-skewed with a relatively high percentage of people who knew at least one programming language. Such technically savvy people have been found to be more likely to read about security information. Even though our re. e data we collected contains information only about posts that participants explicitly interacted with on Facebook or Twitter, we could analyze only those posts. We were particularly interested in studying active engagement with content as opposed to passive engagement (i.e., seeing posts without interaction) The SBO collected data exclusively from Windows computer users. People who use other operating systems may exhibit different social media and security behaviors. The frequency of security and privacy posts will likely be even lower with a less technically savvy population. The nature of the SBO data collection infrastructure, participants may be skewed toward people with lower concerns about security. Despite this, participants tended to self-report high on the SeBIS intentions scale [27]. We do not believe our findings arefundamentally affected by this. On average, 64% of the participants whose data we studied indicated a frequency of “sometimes’ or higher for the extent that they: a) secure their devices, b) generate strong and varied passwords, c) demonstrate proactive awareness of security issues, and d) update their computer software. Several studies have successfully used the SBO for exploring various questions related to security and privacy [9, 16, 33, 37, 60]. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. We found that, more often than not, discussions about security and privacy revolved around jokes or sarcasm. Posts sometimes described security experiences with clear lessons, but very rarely did posts include constructive, actionable advice. We next discuss the implications of our findings on increasing the dissemination of security                and privacy information through social networks and what may constitute effective security andprivacy education for the consumers of this information.7.1 Disseminating security andPrivacy advice in social networks. We were surprised t we found that people often mentioned a security- or privacy-related buzzword without discussing it further. Only 175 posts related to security and privacy out of 194,081 social media posts that we examined. Security and privacy posts’ popularity and spread may be overshadowed by other topics. Researchers have found that socialinfluence can in experimental settings encourage people to take security-enhancing actions. However, through measurement of historical social-media interactions and behavior, our findings suggest that the negativelypositive influence of real social media may not be as strong as previously thought. It is possible that users are not explicitly interacting with security- and privacy-related posts even if they encounter them on social media. Social media posts and discussions on security behavior may not be as high or as likely as experimental results suggested. Future work could explore how to launch large-scale security and privacy publicity campaigns on social media. These campaigns have typically beenconducted through mass media such as radio and television. However, organizations that typicallyrely on these mass media outlets have the potential to reach a wider group of people through social media than just t-shirt and adverts. For more information on how to use social media to improve security behavior, visit the National Institute of Standards and Technology website. News media outlets may be able to play a significant role in furthering security and privacy campaigns on social media. Social media influencers have also had success withreaching many social media users with the goals of providing advice or influencing the purchase of products. Future work could take lessons from previous work examining what makes posts in other topic domains popular. The ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264, will be published in November 2022.

The effectiveness of approaches to increasing interactions could be measured by the popularity of postsrelated to security and privacy. Future work could evaluate the effectiveness of these constructive posts on a large scale to identify recommendations for howsecurity and privacy advice can be presented so as to encourage adoption of good practices. We found that some posts constructivelydiscussed security and. privacy either by providing explicit advice or by conveying an anecdote. in which certain specific security practices helped the post author.  [43, 50, 52]. Implementing security in systems has often been an afterthought in system design. As a result, systems oftenplace the burden of deciding to implement security on its users. Much of the research in the security and privacy communityvocates for factoring security into system design from the start and relieving people of the burden. For example, social engineering attacks (e.g., shoulder-surfing, etc.) can be used to gain access to a user's personal information. The degree to which users should be educated about security and Privacy remains an open question. Security education is still important to inform people of the decisions they may need to make and steps to take to achieve the level of digital security they expect. Our study suggests that computer users are unlikely to learn to improve their security behaviors through their general interactions with online content. This suggests that more intentional security and privacy education and designing systems that further remove the burde is needed to reduce the risk of cyber-phishing and other forms of security breaches. The use of password managers is still uncommon. We analyzed real Facebook and Twitter logs and security behavior data from 38 participants over almost four years. We identified a surprisingly low number (0.09%) of posts out of over 200,000 posts in the social media logs we analyzed to be about security and privacy. We gained insight into the underlying nature of the security- and privacy-related posts on Facebook andTwitter by conducting a thematic analysis. We found that the majority of posts on social media were not related to security or privacy. The Scarcity and Ambiguity of Security Advice on Social Media. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. Publication date: November 2022. Only one theme described posts that. spoke constructively about security and privacy. These constructive posts made up only 20% of the already small pool of security. and privacy posts we identified. Posts often spoke about.security and privacy in passing, through jokes or sarcasm, or through anecdotes without conveying. information about healthy or unhealthy security behavior. This work was supported in part by the Carnegie Mellon University CyLab Security and PrivacyInstitute. Parts of the dataset we used were created through work supported by the National Security Agency under Award No. H9823018D0008. We would also like to thank Sarah Pearman and Jeremy Thomas for help with working with the SBO data. We discussed directions for future work toward achieving widespread constructive security awareness and behavior. We also discussed how to improve the efficacy of security and privacy posts in encouraging healthier, more effective security behavior.

This dataset contains information about every post or tweet interacted with. Each Facebook interaction contains the timestamp of the interaction, the type of interaction (i.e., like, comment, save, or create/share), information about the posters, and the post text. Each Twitter interaction. contains the date and time of the original. post interacted with, thetype of interaction, and information about. the posters. The paper is published in the Proceedings of the Symposium On Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) The dataset contains information about every URL visited in                the web browser, along with page titles and timestamps. We filtered this dataset to exclude passwords used during failed login attempts or entered by a user other than the main computer user. The dataset includes information about all events related toinstalled software and software updates on participants’ computers along with Windows updates. The study was published in ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. Data about one event includes information about whether it corresponds to an update or new software installed. Data about one file includes the file name and path, the hash of the file in both MD5 and SHA1, and the timestamp for when the file was created. n date: November 2022. The Scarcity and Ambiguity of Security Advice on Social Media is published in the open-access book ‘The Scarcity of Security in Social Media’ (Penguin, 2013) This dataset contains the history of the different Windows operating system versions participants have used throughout the duration of the SBO. Data about one version includes the operating system version and the timestamp at which that specific version was installed. This dataset consists of the Windows software update settings participants set for their computers at various points in time. It also contains information about all the WiFi networks participants used during the study. The SBO is open source and can be downloaded as an open source project by any computer user. Data about one instance of connecting to a WiFi network includes the name of the WiFi profile, whether the network required authentication, and the type of encryption used. Data about one event corresponding to setting or modifying permissions for a website includes which of theabove permissions the participants granted to that website as well as the timestamp for when those particular permissions were set. The dataset contains information about what content participants allow various websites to use within their browser, i.e., microphone, location, or camera permissions. We started with an initial list of regular expressions (regexes) After our iterative algorithm, we ended up with a final list of regexes for each category. Table 7 shows the regexes in both the                initial and final lists. The final list includes the following categories: security and privacy, technology, and data breaches. The ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264. Publication date: November 2022. Table 7.4 Statistical relationships between social media interactions and security behavior. We studied the relationship between people’s interactions with security- and privacy-related posts. To study this, we used behaviors des des  “des” to flag posts within three categories. Initial regexes are in black while the regexes in green were added via the iterative process. We used behaviors des ‘des’ to flag Facebook or Twitter posts within two categories and three categories respectively. We also looked at behaviors des  “”“Des’. The outcomes we studied were behaviors indicating better or worse security practices. For this analysis, we analyzed the data of the 38 participants who gave us social media data along with eight additional participants who we consider non-social media users. We identified these eight participants by examining all their webpage visits (as recorded by the SBO) and determining that they did not visit webpages on the Facebook or Twitter websites since 2016. The behaviors we were interested in modeling typically weren’t directly part of the raw data we collected. For each participant, we created separate features for Facebook and Twitter since the way content is shared on each platform differs. We identified the security and privacy posts in Sec. 4 and posts in the second two topics following a similar process with different initial lists for each category. We designated three features to describe the total number of interactions with posts in each category on Facebook and three more to describe this number for Twitter. Prior work has found that the source of security andPrivacy posts on Facebook is the social network itself. We describe interactions with posts along dimensions related to the source of a social media post. These dimensions include the type of poster (friend or page), the familiarity of the poster (the number of times the user previously interacted with that poster), and the poster’s popularity (e.g., number of followers). Common to both platforms, for posts in each category, we describe: the number of posts that were consumed versus shared by the participant. We also describe the average number of people who were the sole author of the post they were interacting with. Twitter included: the average number of followers of all the posters of posts interacted with. Facebook included the number of posts either originally posted or re-shared by a public page. If a participant did not have either a Facebook or Twitter account (including those who had no social media account or visits), their corresponding feature values were set to 0. Each participant was also associated with outcomes representing their security behavior (asintroduced in Sec. 3) which were inspired by or built upon previous work [9, 16, 33, 60, 81]. In total, participants were represented by 44 features related to social media including interactions with security and privacy, technical, and breach content on Facebook and Twitter and 25 indicatorsrelated to security behavior. Features related to operating system (OS) updates described thenumber of OS updates and the number of times the OS update settings were modified. Other features included the average strength across each domain’s latest password and number of open Wi-Fi networks participants connected to. A list of all security behavior indicators along with theirdescriptions can be found in Table 9. Whether the participant had a Facebook account.

The total number of comments on a post. The amount of time it took for a post to be shared by two or more people. Factor analysis. Features related to social media consumption describe posts in each of the following categories:sec_priv, tech, and breach. We considered six factors that had at least two features with a factor loading greater than 0.7 [25, 63, 75]. The remaining two factors did not have a sufficient number of factor loadings great. The average familiarity of each poster involved in all posts in the three categories is shown in Table 8.5. We then computed statistical relationships between the factors describing social media. The factors described the number of interactions overall with technical posts on Twitter and those made specifically by familiar posters on Facebook. Based on the features with loadings above 0.7 in each factor, the factors were considered. The ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. CSCW2, Article 264, will be published in November 2022.

Security behavior indicators across browsing and system-level datasets. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact., Vol. 6, No. 6,. CSCW2, Article 264.264:24:24-24. We first conducted Pearson’s pairwise correlation tests. We found that no pair exhibited a strong correlation (i.e., above 0.7 [56]). Considering the raw feat, we found that there was no correlation between the six social media factors and each of the two security behavior factors. We constructed a non-parametric linear quantile regression model of the relationship between all six social media-related input factors and the four demographic features. We did not find any of the social media factors to be consistently correlated with either of the security behavior factors. We also conducted pairwise correlations between each original social media and worrisomedemographic feature against each security behavior and observed similar results. We required a sample size of 36, a criteria our dataset meets [4, 17, 28, 51, 57, 78]. The models for the 90th percentile revealed that being a student was correlated with a higher tendency to visit malicious URLs. More interactions with security and privacy content were correlated with having more antivirussoftware installed. However, no social media factor was correlation with any of the security behavior factors according to more than one model computed for one of the four percentiles, thus implying a lack of correlation.
