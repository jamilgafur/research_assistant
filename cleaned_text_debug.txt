1. Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

We investigate whether neural networks optimize to the same, linearly connected minimum under different samples of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) noise. Our findings suggest that standard vision models become stable to SGD noise early in training, resulting in a linearly connected region from then on.

2. Introduction

When training a neural network with mini-batch SGD, examples are presented in random order within each epoch, and often undergo random data augmentation. This randomness can be seen as noise that alters the network's trajectory through the optimization landscape, even when initialization and hyperparameters are fixed.

3. Instability Analysis

To study this effect, we propose instability analysis. We create a network N with random initialization W0 and train two copies of N with different samples of SGD noise, varying random data orders and augmentations. By comparing the resulting networks, we determine stability to SGD noise based on linear interpolation along the line between these networks.

If the error remains flat or decreases, we consider the networks stable in a linearly connected minimum. We define instability as the maximum increase in error along this path and consider N stable if error does not increase along this path, meaning instability is approximately 0. This ensures that the network will find the same, linearly connected minimum regardless of the sample of SGD noise.

4. Our Approach

We perform instability analysis on standard networks for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet, exploring linear mode connectivity throughout training at larger scales. We focus on different samples of SGD noise rather than disjoint samples of data, which allows us to investigate a broader range of scenarios.------------------------------original text: 
Linear Mode Connectivity and the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

Abstract

We study whether a neural network optimizes to
the same, linearly connected minimum under dif-
ferent samples of SGD noise (e.g., random data
order and augmentation). We ﬁnd that standard
vision models become stable to SGD noise in this
way early in training. From then on, the outcome
of optimization is determined to a linearly con-
nected region. We use this technique to study
iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), the procedure
used by work on the lottery ticket hypothesis to
identify subnetworks that could have trained in
isolation to full accuracy. We ﬁnd that these sub-
networks only reach full accuracy when they are
stable to SGD noise, which either occurs at initial-
ization for small-scale settings (MNIST) or early
in training for large-scale settings (ResNet-50 and
Inception-v3 on ImageNet).

1. Introduction

When training a neural network with mini-batch stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), training examples are presented to
the network in a random order within each epoch. In many
cases, each example also undergoes random data augmen-
tation. This randomness can be seen as noise that varies
from training run to training run and alters the network’s tra-
jectory through the optimization landscape, even when the
initialization and hyperparameters are ﬁxed. In this paper,
we investigate how this SGD noise affects the outcome of
optimizing neural networks and the role this effect plays in
sparse, lottery ticket networks (Frankle & Carbin, 2019).

Instability analysis. To study these questions, we propose
instability analysis. The goal of instability analysis is to
determine whether the outcome of optimizing a particular
neural network is stable to SGD noise. Figure 1 (left) visual-
izes instability analysis. First, we create a network N with
random initialization W0. We then train two copies of N

with different samples of SGD noise (i.e., different random
data orders and augmentations). Finally, we compare the
resulting networks to measure the effect of these different
samples of SGD noise on the outcome of optimization. If
the networks are sufﬁciently similar according to a criterion,
we determine N to be stable to SGD noise. We also study
this behavior starting from the state of N at step k of train-
ing (Figure 1 right). Doing so allows us to determine when
the outcome of optimization becomes stable to SGD noise.

There are many possible ways in which to compare the
networks that result from instability analysis (Appendix G).
We use the behavior of the optimization landscape along
the line between these networks (blue in Figure 1). Does
error remain ﬂat or even decrease (meaning the networks
are in the same, linearly connected minimum), or is there a
barrier of increased error? We deﬁne the linear interpolation
instability of N to SGD noise as the maximum increase
in error along this path (red). We consider N stable to
SGD noise if error does not increase along this path, i.e.,
instability ≈ 0. This means N will ﬁnd the same, linearly
connected minimum regardless of the sample of SGD noise.

By linearly interpolating at the end of training in this fashion,
we assess a linear form of mode connectivity, a phenomenon
where the minima found by two networks are connected
by a path of nonincreasing error. Freeman & Bruna (2017),
Draxler et al. (2018), and Garipov et al. (2018) show that the
modes of standard vision networks trained from different
initializations are connected by nonlinear paths of constant
error or loss. Based on this work, we expect that all networks
we examine are connected by such paths. However, the
modes found by Draxler et al. and Garipov et al. are not
connected by linear paths. The only extant example of
linear mode connectivity is by Nagarajan & Kolter (2019),
who train MLPs from the same initialization on disjoint

subsets of MNIST and ﬁnd that the resulting networks are
connected by linear paths of constant test error. In contrast,
we explore linear mode connectivity from points throughout
training, we do so at larger scales, and we focus on different
samples of SGD noise rather than disjoint samples of data.

We perform instability analysis on standard networks for
MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet. All but the smallest
MNIST network are unstable to SGD noise at initialization
according to linear interpolation. However,--------------------cleaned text: 

Early in training, all neural networks become stable to SGD noise, meaning that the outcome of optimization is determined by a linearly connected minimum. From this point on, the stability of a network to SGD noise becomes a crucial factor in determining its success.

The lottery ticket hypothesis proposes that sparse subnetworks within neural networks can train independently to full accuracy without additional training. We tested this idea using iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), which retroactively finds subnetworks at initialization that can match the performance of the full network. However, IMP was found to be less successful for larger networks like VGGs and ResNets.

We showed that instability analysis distinguishes between cases where IMP succeeds and fails to find matching subnetworks. Instability occurs when a network is stable to SGD noise according to linear interpolation. By using this insight, we identified new scenarios where sparse IMP subnetworks can be found at nontrivial sparsities, even in challenging settings.

In these settings, sparse IMP subnetworks become stable to SGD noise early in training, rather than just at initialization. This finding provides new insights into neural network training dynamics and sheds light on possible mechanisms underlying the lottery ticket phenomenon. Our results suggest that instability analysis is a valuable tool for understanding the behavior of deep learning models.

Contributions:

* We introduced instability analysis as a method to determine the stability of a neural network to SGD noise.
* We observed that all networks become stable to SGD noise early in training, regardless of their size or complexity.
* We used instability analysis to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful cases of IMP, revealing that sparse IMP subnetworks are only matching when they are stable to SGD noise.
* We generalized IMP to find subnetworks early in training, rather than just at initialization, making it possible to extend the lottery ticket observations to larger scales.

Preliminaries and Methodology:

To perform instability analysis, we train two copies of a network with different random samples of SGD noise and compare their trained weights. The difference between these weights gives us an idea of the stability of the network to SGD noise. We then use linear interpolation to estimate the error barrier height along the optimization path between two networks.

Formally, let E(W) be the (train or test) error of a network with weights W. Let Eα(W1, W2) = E(αW1 + (1 − α)W2) for α ∈ [0, 1] be the error of the network along the linear path between W1 and W2.

by a point early
in training (3% for ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 and 20% for
ResNet-50 on ImageNet), all networks become stable to
SGD noise. From this point on, the outcome of optimization
is determined to a linearly connected minimum.

The lottery ticket hypothesis. Finally, we show that insta-
bility analysis and linear interpolation are valuable scientiﬁc
tools for understanding other phenomena in deep learning.
Speciﬁcally, we study the sparse networks discussed by the
recent lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH; Frankle & Carbin,
2019). The LTH conjectures that, at initialization, neural
networks contain sparse subnetworks that can train in isola-
tion to full accuracy.

Empirical evidence for the LTH consists of experiments
using a procedure called iterative magnitude pruning (IMP).
On small networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10, IMP retroac-
tively ﬁnds subnetworks at initialization that can train to the
same accuracy as the full network (we call such subnetworks
matching). Importantly, IMP ﬁnds matching subnetworks
at nontrivial sparsity levels, i.e., those beyond which sub-
networks found by trivial random pruning are matching.
In more challenging settings, however, there is no empiri-
cal evidence for the LTH: IMP subnetworks of VGGs and
ResNets on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet are not matching at
nontrivial sparsities (Liu et al., 2019; Gale et al., 2019).

We show that instability analysis distinguishes known cases
where IMP succeeds and fails to ﬁnd matching subnetworks
at nontrivial sparsities, providing the ﬁrst basis for under-
standing the mixed results in the literature. Namely, IMP
subnetworks are only matching when they are stable to
SGD noise according to linear interpolation. Using this
insight, we identify new scenarios where we can ﬁnd sparse,
matching subnetworks at nontrivial sparsities, including in
more challenging settings (e.g., ResNet-50 on ImageNet).
In these settings, sparse IMP subnetworks become stable to
SGD noise early in training rather than at initialization, just
as we ﬁnd with the unpruned networks. Moreover, these
stable IMP subnetworks are also matching. In other words,
early in training (if not at initialization), sparse subnetworks
emerge that can complete training in isolation and reach full
accuracy. These ﬁndings shed new light on neural network
training dynamics, hint at possible mechanisms underly-
ing lottery ticket phenomena, and extend the lottery ticket
observations to larger scales.

Contributions. We make the following contributions:

• We introduce instability analysis to determine whether
the outcome of optimizing a neural network is stable to
SGD noise, and we suggest linear mode connectivity for
making this determination.

• On a range of image classiﬁcation benchmarks including
standard networks on ImageNet, we observe that net-
works become stable to SGD noise early in training.
• We use instability analysis to distinguish successes and
failures of IMP (the method behind extant lottery ticket
results). Namely, sparse IMP subnetworks are matching
only when they are stable to SGD noise.

• We generalize IMP to ﬁnd subnetworks early in train-
ing rather than at initialization. We show that IMP sub-
networks become stable and matching when set to their
weights from early in training, making it possible to ex-
tend the lottery ticket observations to larger scales.

Instability analysis. To perform instability analysis on a
network N with weights W , we make two copies of N and
train them with different random samples of SGD noise (i.e.,
different data orders and augmentations), producing trained
weights W 1
T . We compare these weights with a
function, producing a value we call the instability of N to
SGD noise. We then determine whether this value satisﬁes
a criterion indicating that N is stable to SGD noise. The
weights of N could be randomly initialized (W = W0 in
Figure 1) or the result of k training steps (W = Wk).
Formally, we model SGD by function As→t : RD × U →
RD that maps weights Ws ∈ RD at step s and SGD ran-
domness u ∼ U to weights Wt ∈ RD at step t by training
for t − s steps (s, t ∈ {0, .., T }). Algorithm 1 outlines
instability analysis with a function f : RD × RD → R.

Linear interpolation. Consider a path p on the optimiza-
tion landscape between networks W1 and W2. We deﬁne
the error barrier height of p as the maximum increase in
error from that of W1 and W2 along path p. For instability
analysis, we use as our function f the error barrier height
along the linear path between two networks W1 and W2.1

Formally, let E(W ) be the (train or test) error of a network
with weights W . Let Eα(W1, W2) = E(αW1 + (1 − α)W2)
for α ∈ [0, 1] be the error of the networ--------------------cleaned text: 

Our model was created by linearly interpolating between W1 and W2. The highest error when interpolating, Esup(W1, W2), occurs along the linear path between the two networks, which is our function for analyzing instability. When we perform this analysis on a network N, we call this quantity the linear interpolation stability (shorthand: instability) of N to SGD noise.

Two networks are mode connected if there exists a path between them along which the error barrier height ≈ 0. They are linearly mode connected if this is true along the linear path. For stability analysis, we consider a network N stable to SGD noise when the linear interpolation instability of N ≈ 0; otherwise, it is unstable.

We empirically consider instability < 2% to be stable, accounting for noise and matching increases in error along paths found by Draxler et al. (2018) and Garipov et al. (2018). We use 30 evenly spaced values of α and average stability from three initializations and three runs per initialization (nine combinations total).

We studied image classification networks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet as listed in Table 1. All hyperparameters are standard values from reference code or prior work as cited in Table 1.

The warmup and low variants of ResNet-20 and VGG-16 are adapted from hyperparameters in Frankle & Carbin (2019). 

We perform instability analysis on the standard networks in Table 1 from many points during training. We find that although only LeNet is stable to SGD noise at initialization, every network becomes stable early in training, meaning the outcome of optimization from that point forward is determined by a linearly connected minimum.

Instability analysis at initialisation. First, we perform instability analysis from initialisation. We use Algorithm 1 with W0 (visualized in Figure 1 left): train two copies of the same, randomly initialized network with different samples of SGD noise. Figure 2 shows the train (purple) and test (red) error when linearly interpolating between the minimum found by these copies. Except for LeNet(MNIST), none of the networks are stable at initialisation. In fact, the train and test error rise to the point of random guessing when linearly interpolating. LeNet's error rises slightly but by less than a percentage point.

We conclude that, in general, larger-scale image classification networks are unstable at initialisation according to linear interpolation.------------------------------original text:

When training neural networks, stability is a crucial factor in achieving optimal performance. Our analysis shows that, after a certain point, instability becomes negligible regardless of the presence of SGD noise.

We analyze this phenomenon by looking at the linear interpolation stability of networks at different stages of training, particularly when making two copies of the network and training them for varying numbers of steps with different learning rates. The results indicate that as we increase the number of training steps, the instability of the test set decreases, culminating in stable networks.

Notably, ResNet-20 and VGG-16 become relatively stable early in training, while ResNet-50 and Inception-v3 take longer to stabilize. When comparing train and test stability, we find that these two quantities are essentially equivalent for LeNet, ResNet-20, and VGG-16. However, for ResNet-50 and Inception-v3, the train set stability occurs slightly later.

To disentangle instability from training time, we modify our analysis to train copies of the network for a fixed number of iterations instead of steps. This modification does not affect the results, indicating that the impact of training time is minimal in this context.

Overall, our results shed new light on the behavior of sparse neural networks and provide insights into their potential as lottery ticket networks.------------------------------original text:

4. Instability Analysis of Lottery Tickets

In this section, we leverage instability analysis and our
observations about linear mode connectivity to gain new
insights into the behavior of sparse lottery ticket networks.

4.1. Overview

We have long known that it is possible to prune neural net-
works after training, often removing 90% of weights without
reducing accuracy after some additional training (e.g., Reed,
1993; Han et al., 2015; Gale et al., 2019). However, sparse
networks are more difﬁcult to train from scratch. Beyond
trivial sparsities where many weights remain and random
subnetworks can train to full accuracy, sparse networks
trained in isolation are generally less accurate than the cor-
responding dense networks (Han et al., 2015; Li et al., 2017;
Liu et al., 2019; Frankle & Carbin, 2019).

However, there is a known class of sparse networks that
remain accurate at nontrivial sparsities. On small vision
tasks, an algorithm called iterative magnitude pruning (IMP)
retroactively ﬁnds sparse subnetworks that were capable of
training in isolation fr--------------------cleaned text: 

2.4 DNS—the Internet's Directory Service

Imagine you're trying to find someone in a crowded room. You could use their social security number or driver's license number, but it might be more convenient to know their name. Just like humans have multiple ways of being identified, Internet hosts can also be identified by different methods. One common way is through a hostname, which is easy for humans to remember but doesn't reveal much about the host's location.

For example, imagine you're trying to find a website like www.facebook.com or www.google.com. You can easily type in these memorable hostnames, but what if you need to look up a more specific IP address? In that case, hosts use something called an IP address, which is made up of four numbers (called bytes) separated by dots and expressed in decimal notation. Think of it like a postal address: when you scan the address from left to right, you get more information about where the host is located within the Internet.

When we use a hostname, we want to be able to find the corresponding IP address quickly and efficiently. This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes in. The DNS acts as a directory service that translates hostnames to IP addresses, allowing hosts to communicate with each other.

The DNS works like this: when you enter a URL into your browser, it uses a protocol called HTTP to request an IP address for the hostname from a DNS server. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to the DNS server, and then receives a reply that includes the IP address. Once the browser gets the IP address, it can initiate a TCP connection to the HTTP server process located at port 80.

In addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses, DNS also provides other important services like host aliasing. This means that if you have multiple aliases for a hostname (like enterprise.com or www.enterprise.com), the DNS can help resolve them into a single canonical hostname. Overall, DNS plays a crucial role in making it easier for hosts to communicate with each other online.

2.4 DNS—The Internet’s Directory Service

We human beings can be identified in many ways. For example, we can be identified by the names that

appear on our birth certificates. We can be identified by our social security numbers. We can be

identified by our driver’s license numbers. Although each of these identifiers can be used to identify

people, within a given context one identifier may be more appropriate than another. For example, the

computers at the IRS (the infamous tax-collecting agency in the United States) prefer to use fixed-length

social security numbers rather than birth certificate names. On the other hand, ordinary people prefer

the more mnemonic birth certificate names rather than social security numbers. (Indeed, can you

imagine saying, “Hi. My name is 132-67-9875. Please meet my husband, 178-87-1146.”)

Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its

hostname. Hostnames—such as  www.facebook.com, www.google.com ,

gaia.cs.umass.edu —are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans. However,
hostnames provide little, if any, information about the location within the Internet of the host. (A

hostname such as  www.eurecom.fr , which ends with the country code  .fr , tells us that the host is
probably in France, but doesn’t say much more.) Furthermore, because hostnames can consist of

variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers. For these

reasons, hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.

We discuss IP addresses in some detail in Chapter 4, but it is useful to say a few brief words about
them now. An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical structure. An IP address

looks like  121.7.106.83 , where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal

notation from 0 to 255. An IP address is hierarchical because as we scan the address from left to right,

we obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet (that is,

within which network, in the network of networks). Similarly, when we scan a postal address from bottom

to top, we obtain more and more specific information about where the addressee is located.

2.4.1 Services Provided by DNS

We have just seen that there are two ways to identify a host—by a hostname and by an IP address.

People prefer the more mnemonic hostname identifier, while routers prefer fixed-length, hierarchically

structured IP addresses. In order to reconcile these preferences, we need a directory service that

translates hostnames to IP addresses. This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system

(DNS). The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an

application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. The DNS servers are often

UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software [BIND 2016]. The DNS
protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53.

DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols—including HTTP and SMTP to

translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses. As an example, consider what happens when a

browser (that is, an HTTP client), running on some user’s host, requests the URL

www.someschool.edu/index.html . In order for the user’s host to be able to send an HTTP request

message to the Web server  www.someschool.edu , the user’s host must first obtain the IP address of

www.someschool.edu . This is done as follows.

1.  The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application.
2.  The browser extracts the hostname,  www.someschool.edu , from the URL and passes the

hostname to the client side of the DNS application.

3.  The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server.
4.  The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname.
5.  Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the

HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address.

We see from this example that DNS adds an additional delay—sometimes substantial—to the Internet

applications that use it. Fortunately, as we discuss below, the desired IP address is often cached in a

“nearby” DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay.

DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses:

Host aliasing. A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. For

example, a hostname such as  relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  could have, say, two

aliases such as  enterprise.com  and  www.enterprise.com . In this case, the hostname
relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  is said to be a canonical hostname. Alias hostnames,

when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. DNS can be invoked by an

application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostn--------------------cleaned text: 

The Domain Name System (DNS) allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names instead of complicated IP addresses. For example, a user can use the alias "bob@yahoo.mail" to access their email account, but the actual hostname is something like "relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com." DNS helps companies and organizations have multiple servers with the same hostname by using a technique called load distribution. This way, if one server becomes too busy, traffic is automatically redirected to another server, ensuring that users can still access their websites and emails.

Load Distribution

DNS also enables load distribution among replicated servers, such as web servers. Imagine a popular website like cnn.com, which is replicated on multiple servers with different IP addresses. To make it easier for visitors to access the site, DNS distributes traffic across these servers by sending them to the first available server listed in the set of IP addresses. This ensures that no one server becomes overwhelmed and that users can continue to access the website smoothly.

DNS: Critical Network Function

The DNS protocol is an application-layer protocol that relies on a client-server paradigm to translate hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses. Unlike applications like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, which run directly between communicating end systems, DNS messages are transferred using an underlying transport protocol. The DNS acts as a critical Internet function by providing this core service, translating hostnames to IP addresses for user applications and other software.

In practice, DNS is implemented on the "edges" of the network, where clients and servers interact. To understand how DNS works, imagine a process that translates a hostname to an IP address. The application or user sends a request to the client side of DNS, which then sends a query message into the network. After a delay, the response is received, providing the desired mapping. From the user's perspective, DNS appears as a simple and straightforward translation service, but in reality, it involves complex interactions between multiple DNS servers and protocols.

A Simple Design

One might imagine a simplified design for DNS where all mappings are stored on a single server. However, this approach is impractical because it would lead to network congestion and slow response times if one server becomes overwhelmed.------------------------------original text: 
ame as well as the IP address

of the host.

Mail server aliasing. For obvious reasons, it is highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic.
For example, if Bob has an account with Yahoo Mail, Bob’s e-mail address might be as simple as

bob@yahoo.mail . However, the hostname of the Yahoo mail server is more complicated and

much less mnemonic than simply  yahoo.com  (for example, the canonical hostname might be

something like  relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com ). DNS can be invoked by a mail application to

obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host.

In fact, the MX record (see below) permits a company’s mail server and Web server to have identical

(aliased) hostnames; for example, a company’s Web server and mail server can both be called

enterprise.com .
Load distribution. DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as

replicated Web servers. Busy sites, such as  cnn.com , are replicated over multiple servers, with
each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address. For replicated

Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname. The DNS
database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to

a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering

of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to

the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated

servers. DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias

name. Also, content distribution companies such as Akamai have used DNS in more sophisticated

ways [Dilley 2002] to provide Web content distribution (see Section 2.6.3).

The DNS is specified in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035, and updated in several additional RFCs. It is a

complex system, and we only touch upon key aspects of its

PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE

DNS: CRITICAL NETWORK FUNCTIONS VIA THE CLIENT-SERVER PARADIGM

Like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, the DNS protocol is an application-layer protocol since it (1) runs

between communicating end systems using the client-server paradigm and (2) relies on an

underlying end-to-end transport protocol to transfer DNS messages between communicating

end systems. In another sense, however, the role of the DNS is quite different from Web, file

transfer, and e-mail applications. Unlike these applications, the DNS is not an application with

which a user directly interacts. Instead, the DNS provides a core Internet function—namely,

translating hostnames to their underlying IP addresses, for user applications and other software

in the Internet. We noted in Section 1.2 that much of the complexity in the Internet architecture
is located at the “edges” of the network. The DNS, which implements the critical name-to-

address translation process using clients and servers located at the edge of the network, is yet

another example of that design philosophy.

operation here. The interested reader is referred to these RFCs and the book by Albitz and Liu [Albitz

1993]; see also the retrospective paper [Mockapetris 1988], which provides a nice description of the

what and why of DNS, and [Mockapetris 2005].

2.4.2 Overview of How DNS Works

We now present a high-level overview of how DNS works. Our discussion will focus on the hostname-to-

IP-address translation service.

Suppose that some application (such as a Web browser or a mail reader) running in a user’s host needs

to translate a hostname to an IP address. The application will invoke the client side of DNS, specifying

the hostname that needs to be translated. (On many UNIX-based machines,  gethostbyname()  is the

function call that an application calls in order to perform the translation.) DNS in the user’s host then

takes over, sending a query message into the network. All DNS query and reply messages are sent

within UDP datagrams to port 53. After a delay, ranging from milliseconds to seconds, DNS in the user’s

host receives a DNS reply message that provides the desired mapping. This mapping is then passed to

the invoking application. Thus, from the perspective of the invoking application in the user’s host, DNS is

a black box providing a simple, straightforward translation service. But in fact, the black box that

implements the service is complex, consisting of a large number of DNS servers distributed around the

globe, as well as an application-layer protocol that specifies how the DNS servers and querying hosts

communicate.

A simple design for DNS would have one DNS server that contains all the mappings. In this centralized

design, clients simply direct all queries to the single DNS server, and the DNS server responds directly

to the querying clients. Although the simplicity of this design is attractive, it is inappropriate--------------------cleaned text:

We see from this example that DNS adds an additional delay—sometimes substantial—to the Internet

applications that use it. Fortunately, as we discuss below, the desired IP address is often cached in a

“nearby” DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay.

DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses:

Host aliasing. A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. For

example, a hostname such as  relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  could have, say, two

aliases such as  enterprise.com  and  www.enterprise.com . In this case, the hostname
relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  is said to be a canonical hostname. Alias hostnames,

when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. DNS can be invoked by an

application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostn--------------------cleaned text: 

2.4 DNS—The Internet’s Directory Service

We human beings can be identified in many ways. For example, we can be identified by the names that

appear on our birth certificates. We can be identified by our social security numbers. We can be

identified by our driver’s license numbers. Although each of these identifiers can be used to identify

people, within a given context one identifier may be more appropriate than another. For example, the

computers at the IRS (the infamous tax-collecting agency in the United States) prefer to use fixed-length

social security numbers rather than birth certificate names. On the other hand, ordinary people prefer

the more mnemonic birth certificate names rather than social security numbers. (Indeed, can you

imagine saying, “Hi. My name is 132-67-9875. Please meet my husband, 178-87-1146.”)

Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its

hostname. Hostnames—such as www.facebook.com, www.google.com, gaia.cs.umass.edu —are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans. However,
hostnames provide little, if any, information about the location within the Internet of the host. (A

hostname such as www.eurecom.fr, which ends with the country code .fr, tells us that the host is
probably in France, but doesn’t say much more.) Furthermore, because hostnames can consist of

variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers. For these

reasons, hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.

We discuss IP addresses in some detail in Chapter 4, but it is useful to say a few brief words about
them now. An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical structure. An IP address looks like
121.7.106.83, where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal notation from 0 to 255.
An IP address is hierarchical because as we scan the address from left to right,
we obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet (that is,

within which network, in the network of networks). Similarly, when we scan a postal address from bottom

to top, we obtain more and more specific information about where the addressee is located.

2.4.1 Services Provided by DNS

We have just seen that there are two ways to identify a host—by a hostname and by an IP address.

People prefer the more mnemonic hostname identifier, while routers prefer fixed-length, hierarchically

structured IP addresses. In order to reconcile these preferences, we need a directory service that

translates hostnames to IP addresses. This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system (DNS).
The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an
application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. The DNS servers are often
UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software [BIND 2016]. The DNS
protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53.

DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols—including HTTP and SMTP to

translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses. As an example, consider what happens when a

browser (that is, an HTTP client), running on some user’s host, requests the URL
www.someschool.edu/index.html. In order for the user’s host to be able to send an HTTP request
message to the Web server www.someschool.edu, the user’s host must first obtain the IP address of

www.someschool.edu. This is done as follows.

1. The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application.
2. The browser extracts the hostname, www.someschool.edu, from the URL and passes the

hostname to the client side of the DNS application.

3. The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server.
4. The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname.
5. Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the

HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address.

We see from this example that DNS adds an additional delay—sometimes substantial—to the Internet
applications that use it. Fortunately, as mentioned earlier, the DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses
port 53. This reduces the latency associated with the request, making the overall experience faster.
Additionally, because the DNS servers are often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain
(BIND) software, they can be easily scaled up or down to meet the needs of a particular application.

For

the purposes of this explanation, it's worth noting that the DNS protocol is quite robust and has many built-in
features that make it useful for applications such as web browsing. These features include:

* Cache: The DNS server caches recent requests so they can be quickly looked up by subsequent requests.
* Reverse lookup: The DNS server can perform a reverse lookup to determine the hostname associated with an IP address.
* Dynamic updates: The DNS server can dynamically update its records based on changes in the underlying network.

DNS can be invoked by an application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias host name.------------------------------original text:

You've started a new text, but it seems like you forgot to finish it or didn't provide the complete content. However, I can try to help you with what's available.

It appears that the text discusses two main topics: Distributed Network Systems (DNS) and Peer-to-Peer File Distribution (BitTorrent).

**Distributed DNS**

The text explains how DNS works in a client-server architecture, where clients send requests to a DNS server, which then responds with IP addresses for web servers. The explanation covers the steps involved in resolving a domain name, including querying a local DNS server, contacting a TLD server, and accessing a root DNS server.

**Peer-to-Peer File Distribution**

The text introduces the concept of peer-to-peer (P2P) file distribution using BitTorrent as an example. It discusses how P2P architectures can distribute files without relying on always-on infrastructure servers, instead using pairs of intermittently connected hosts that communicate directly with each other.

The text highlights the benefits of P2P architectures in file distribution, such as reduced server load and improved scalability. However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of BitTorrent's protocol or its most important characteristics and features.

2.4 DNS—The Internet’s Directory Service

We human beings can be identified in many ways. For example, we can be identified by the names that

appear on our birth certificates. We can be identified by our social security numbers. We can be

identified by our driver’s license numbers. Although each of these identifiers can be used to identify

people, within a given context one identifier may be more appropriate than another. For example, the

computers at the IRS (the infamous tax-collecting agency in the United States) prefer to use fixed-length

social security numbers rather than birth certificate names. On the other hand, ordinary people prefer

the more mnemonic birth certificate names rather than social security numbers. (Indeed, can you

imagine saying, “Hi. My name is 132-67-9875. Please meet my husband, 178-87-1146.”)

Just as humans can be identified in many ways, so too can Internet hosts. One identifier for a host is its

hostname. Hostnames—such as  www.facebook.com, www.google.com ,

gaia.cs.umass.edu —are mnemonic and are therefore appreciated by humans. However,
hostnames provide little, if any, information about the location within the Internet of the host. (A

hostname such as  www.eurecom.fr , which ends with the country code  .fr , tells us that the host is
probably in France, but doesn’t say much more.) Furthermore, because hostnames can consist of

variable-length alphanumeric characters, they would be difficult to process by routers. For these

reasons, hosts are also identified by so-called IP addresses.

We discuss IP addresses in some detail in Chapter 4, but it is useful to say a few brief words about
them now. An IP address consists of four bytes and has a rigid hierarchical structure. An IP address

looks like  121.7.106.83 , where each period separates one of the bytes expressed in decimal

notation from 0 to 255. An IP address is hierarchical because as we scan the address from left to right,

we obtain more and more specific information about where the host is located in the Internet (that is,

within which network, in the network of networks). Similarly, when we scan a postal address from bottom

to top, we obtain more and more specific information about where the addressee is located.

2.4.1 Services Provided by DNS

We have just seen that there are two ways to identify a host—by a hostname and by an IP address.

People prefer the more mnemonic hostname identifier, while routers prefer fixed-length, hierarchically

structured IP addresses. In order to reconcile these preferences, we need a directory service that

translates hostnames to IP addresses. This is the main task of the Internet’s domain name system

(DNS). The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an

application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. The DNS servers are often

UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software [BIND 2016]. The DNS
protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53.

DNS is commonly employed by other application-layer protocols—including HTTP and SMTP to

translate user-supplied hostnames to IP addresses. As an example, consider what happens when a

browser (that is, an HTTP client), running on some user’s host, requests the URL

www.someschool.edu/index.html . In order for the user’s host to be able to send an HTTP request

message to the Web server  www.someschool.edu , the user’s host must first obtain the IP address of

www.someschool.edu . This is done as follows.

1.  The same user machine runs the client side of the DNS application.
2.  The browser extracts the hostname,  www.someschool.edu , from the URL and passes the

hostname to the client side of the DNS application.

3.  The DNS client sends a query containing the hostname to a DNS server.
4.  The DNS client eventually receives a reply, which includes the IP address for the hostname.
5.  Once the browser receives the IP address from DNS, it can initiate a TCP connection to the

HTTP server process located at port 80 at that IP address.

We see from this example that DNS adds an additional delay—sometimes substantial—to the Internet

applications that use it. Fortunately, as we discuss below, the desired IP address is often cached in a

“nearby” DNS server, which helps to reduce DNS network traffic as well as the average DNS delay.

DNS provides a few other important services in addition to translating hostnames to IP addresses:

Host aliasing. A host with a complicated hostname can have one or more alias names. For

example, a hostname such as  relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  could have, say, two

aliases such as  enterprise.com  and  www.enterprise.com . In this case, the hostname
relay1.west-coast.enterprise.com  is said to be a canonical hostname. Alias hostnames,

when present, are typically more mnemonic than canonical hostnames. DNS can be invoked by an

application to obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address

of the host.

Mail server aliasing. For obvious reasons, it is highly desirable that e-mail addresses be mnemonic.
For example, if Bob has an account with Yahoo Mail, Bob’s e-mail address might be as simple as

bob@yahoo.mail . However, the hostname of the Yahoo mail server is more complicated and

much less mnemonic than simply  yahoo.com  (for example, the canonical hostname might be

something like  relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com ). DNS can be invoked by a mail application to

obtain the canonical hostname for a supplied alias hostname as well as the IP address of the host.

In fact, the MX record (see below) permits a company’s mail server and Web server to have identical

(aliased) hostnames; for example, a company’s Web server and mail server can both be called

enterprise.com .
Load distribution. DNS is also used to perform load distribution among replicated servers, such as

replicated Web servers. Busy sites, such as  cnn.com , are replicated over multiple servers, with
each server running on a different end system and each having a different IP address. For replicated

Web servers, a set of IP addresses is thus associated with one canonical hostname. The DNS
database contains this set of IP addresses. When clients make a DNS query for a name mapped to

a set of addresses, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, but rotates the ordering

of the addresses within each reply. Because a client typically sends its HTTP request message to

the IP address that is listed first in the set, DNS rotation distributes the traffic among the replicated

servers. DNS rotation is also used for e-mail so that multiple mail servers can have the same alias

name. Also, content distribution companies such as Akamai have used DNS in more sophisticated

ways [Dilley 2002] to provide Web content distribution (see Section 2.6.3).

The DNS is specified in RFC 1034 and RFC 1035, and updated in several additional RFCs. It is a

complex system, and we only touch upon key aspects of its

PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE

DNS: CRITICAL NETWORK FUNCTIONS VIA THE CLIENT-SERVER PARADIGM

Like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, the DNS protocol is an application-layer protocol since it (1) runs

between communicating end systems using the client-server paradigm and (2) relies on an

underlying end-to-end transport protocol to transfer DNS messages between communicating

end systems. In another sense, however, the role of the DNS is quite different from Web, file

transfer, and e-mail applications. Unlike these applications, the DNS is not an application with

which a user directly interacts. Instead, the DNS provides a core Internet function—namely,

translating hostnames to their underlying IP addresses, for user applications and other software

in the Internet. We noted in Section 1.2 that much of the complexity in the Internet architecture
is located at the “edges” of the network. The DNS, which implements the critical name-to-

address translation process using clients and servers located at the edge of the network, is yet

another example of that design philosophy.

operation here. The interested reader is referred to these RFCs and the book by Albitz and Liu [Albitz

1993]; see also the retrospective paper [Mockapetris 1988], which provides a nice description of the

what and why of DNS, and [Mockapetris 2005].

2.4.2 Overview of How DNS Works

We now present a high-level overview of how DNS works. Our discussion will focus on the hostname-to-

IP-address translation service.

Suppose that some application (such as a Web browser or a mail reader) running in a user’s host needs

to translate a hostname to an IP address. The application will invoke the client side of DNS, specifying

the hostname that needs to be translated. (On many UNIX-based machines,  gethostbyname()  is the

function call that an application calls in order to perform the translation.) DNS in the user’s host then

takes over, sending a query message into the network. All DNS query and reply messages are sent

within UDP datagrams to port 53. After a delay, ranging from milliseconds to seconds, DNS in the user’s

host receives a DNS reply message that provides the desired mapping. This mapping is then passed to

the invoking application. Thus, from the perspective of the invoking application in the user’s host, DNS is

a black box providing a simple, straightforward translation service. But in fact, the black box that

implements the service is complex, consisting of a large number of DNS servers distributed around the

globe, as well as an application-layer protocol that specifies how the DNS servers and querying hosts

communicate.

A simple design for DNS would have one DNS server that contains all the mappings. In this centralized

design, clients simply direct all queries to the single DNS server, and the DNS server responds directly

to the querying clients. Although the simplicity of this design is attractive, it is inappropriate for today’s

Internet, with its vast (and growing) number of hosts. The problems with a centralized design include:

A single point of failure. If the DNS server crashes, so does the entire Internet!

Traffic volume. A single DNS server would have to handle all DNS queries (for all the HTTP
requests and e-mail messages generated from hundreds of millions of hosts).

Distant centralized database. A single DNS server cannot be “close to” all the querying clients. If
we put the single DNS server in New York City, then all queries from Australia must travel to the

other side of the globe, perhaps over slow and congested links. This can lead to significant delays.

Maintenance. The single DNS server would have to keep records for all Internet hosts. Not only
would this centralized database be huge, but it would have to be updated frequently to account for

every new host.

In summary, a centralized database in a single DNS server simply doesn’t scale. Consequently, the
DNS is distributed by design. In fact, the DNS is a wonderful example of how a distributed database can

be implemented in the Internet.

A Distributed, Hierarchical Database

In order to deal with the issue of scale, the DNS uses a large number of servers, organized in a

hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world. No single DNS server has all of the mappings for

all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings are distributed across the DNS servers. To a first

approximation, there are three classes of DNS servers—root DNS servers, top-level domain (TLD) DNS

servers, and authoritative DNS servers—organized in a hierarchy as shown in Figure 2.17. To
understand how these three classes of servers interact, suppose a DNS client wants to determine the IP

address for the hostname  www.amazon.com . To a first

Figure 2.17 Portion of the hierarchy of DNS servers

approximation, the following events will take place. The client first contacts one of the root servers,

which returns IP addresses for TLD servers for the top-level domain  com . The client then contacts one

of these TLD servers, which returns the IP address of an authoritative server for  amazon.com . Finally,

the client contacts one of the authoritative servers for  amazon.com , which returns the IP address for

the hostname  www.amazon.com . We’ll soon examine this DNS lookup process in more detail. But let’s
first take a closer look at these three classes of DNS servers:

Root DNS servers. There are over 400 root name servers scattered all over the world. Figure 2.18
shows the countries that have root names servers, with countries having more than ten darkly

shaded. These root name servers are managed by 13 different organizations. The full list of root

name servers, along with the organizations that manage them and their IP addresses can be found

at [Root Servers 2016]. Root name servers provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers.

Top-level domain (TLD) servers. For each of the top-level domains — top-level domains such as
com, org, net, edu, and gov, and all of the country top-level domains such as uk, fr, ca, and jp —

there is TLD server (or server cluster). The company Verisign Global Registry Services maintains

the TLD servers for the  com  top-level domain, and the company Educause maintains the TLD

servers for the  edu  top-level domain. The network infrastructure supporting a TLD can be large and

complex; see [Osterweil 2012] for a nice overview of the Verisign network. See [TLD list 2016] for
a list of all top-level domains. TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers.

Figure 2.18 DNS root servers in 2016

Authoritative DNS servers. Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers
and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names

of those hosts to IP addresses. An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS

records. An organization can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these

records; alternatively, the organization can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS

server of some service provider. Most universities and large companies implement and maintain

their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.

The root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers all belong to the hierarchy of DNS servers, as shown in

Figure 2.17. There is another important type of DNS server called the local DNS server. A local DNS
server does not strictly belong to the hierarchy of servers but is nevertheless central to the DNS

architecture. Each ISP—such as a residential ISP or an institutional ISP—has a local DNS server (also

called a default name server). When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP provides the host with the IP

addresses of one or more of its local DNS servers (typically through DHCP, which is discussed in

Chapter 4). You can easily determine the IP address of your local DNS server by accessing network
status windows in Windows or UNIX. A host’s local DNS server is typically “close to” the host. For an

institutional ISP, the local DNS server may be on the same LAN as the host; for a residential ISP, it is

typically separated from the host by no more than a few routers. When a host makes a DNS query, the

query is sent to the local DNS server, which acts a proxy, forwarding the query into the DNS server

hierarchy, as we’ll discuss in more detail below.

Let’s take a look at a simple example. Suppose the host  cse.nyu.edu  desires the IP address of

gaia.cs.umass.edu . Also suppose that NYU’s ocal DNS server for  cse.nyu.edu  is called

dns.nyu.edu  and that an authoritative DNS server for  gaia.cs.umass.edu  is called

dns.umass.edu . As shown in Figure 2.19, the host  cse.nyu.edu  first sends a DNS query

message to its local DNS server,  dns.nyu.edu . The query message contains the hostname to be

translated, namely,  gaia.cs.umass.edu . The local DNS server forwards the query message to a
root DNS server. The root DNS server takes note of the edu suffix and returns to the local DNS server a

list of IP addresses for TLD servers responsible for  edu . The local DNS server then resends the query

message to one of these TLD servers. The TLD server takes note of the  umass.edu  suffix and
responds with the IP address of the authoritative DNS server for the University of Massachusetts,

namely,  dns.umass.edu . Finally, the local DNS server resends the query message directly to

dns.umass.edu , which responds with the IP address of  gaia.cs.umass.edu . Note that in this
example, in order to obtain the mapping for one hostname, eight DNS messages were sent: four query

messages and four reply messages! We’ll soon see how DNS caching reduces this query traffic.

Our previous example assumed that the TLD server knows the authoritative DNS server for the

hostname. In general this not always true. Instead, the TLD server

Figure 2.19 Interaction of the various DNS servers

may know only of an intermediate DNS server, which in turn knows the authoritative DNS server for the

hostname. For example, suppose again that the University of Massachusetts has a DNS server for the

university, called  dns.umass.edu . Also suppose that each of the departments at the University of

Massachusetts has its own DNS server, and that each departmental DNS server is authoritative for all

hosts in the department. In this case, when the intermediate DNS server,  dns.umass.edu , receives a

query for a host with a hostname ending with  cs.umass.edu , it returns to  dns.nyu.edu  the IP

address of  dns.cs.umass.edu , which is authoritative for all hostnames ending with  cs.umass.edu .

The local DNS server  dns.nyu.edu  then sends the query to the authoritative DNS server, which

returns the desired mapping to the local DNS server, which in turn returns the mapping to the requesting

host. In this case, a total of 10 DNS messages are sent!

The example shown in Figure 2.19 makes use of both recursive queries and iterative queries. The
query sent from  cse.nyu.edu  to  dns.nyu.edu  is a recursive query, since the query asks

dns.nyu.edu  to obtain the mapping on its behalf. But the subsequent three queries are iterative since

all of the replies are directly returned to  dns.nyu.edu . In theory, any DNS query can be iterative or

recursive. For example, Figure 2.20 shows a DNS query chain for which all of the queries are recursive.

In practice, the queries typically follow the pattern in Figure 2.19: The query from the requesting host to
the local DNS server is recursive, and the remaining queries are iterative.

DNS Caching

Our discussion thus far has ignored DNS caching, a critically important feature of the DNS system. In

truth, DNS extensively exploits DNS caching in order to improve the delay performance and to reduce

the number of DNS messages

Figure 2.20 Recursive queries in DNS

ricocheting around the Internet. The idea behind DNS caching is very simple. In a query chain, when a

DNS server receives a DNS reply (containing, for example, a mapping from a hostname to an IP

address), it can cache the mapping in its local memory. For example, in Figure 2.19, each time the local

DNS server  dns.nyu.edu  receives a reply from some DNS server, it can cache any of the information

contained in the reply. If a hostname/IP address pair is cached in a DNS server and another query

arrives to the DNS server for the same hostname, the DNS server can provide the desired IP address,

even if it is not authoritative for the hostname. Because hosts and mappings between hostnames and IP

addresses are by no means permanent, DNS servers discard cached information after a period of time

(often set to two days).

As an example, suppose that a host  apricot.nyu.edu  queries  dns.nyu.edu  for the IP address for

the hostname  cnn.com . Furthermore, ­suppose that a few hours later, another NYU host, say,

kiwi.nyu.edu , also queries  dns.nyu.edu  with the same hostname. Because of caching, the local

DNS server will be able to immediately return the IP address of  cnn.com  to this second requesting

host without having to query any other DNS servers. A local DNS server can also cache the IP

addresses of TLD servers, thereby allowing the local DNS server to bypass the root DNS servers in a

query chain. In fact, because of caching, root servers are bypassed for all but a very small fraction of

DNS queries.

2.4.3 DNS Records and Messages

The DNS servers that together implement the DNS distributed database store resource records (RRs),

including RRs that provide hostname-to-IP address mappings. Each DNS reply message carries one or

more resource records. In this and the following subsection, we provide a brief overview of DNS

resource records and messages; more details can be found in [Albitz 1993] or in the DNS RFCs [RFC

1034; RFC 1035].

A resource record is a four-tuple that contains the following fields:

(Name, Value, Type, TTL)

TTL  is the time to live of the resource record; it determines when a resource should be removed from a

cache. In the example records given below, we ignore the  TTL  field. The meaning of  Name  and  Value

depend on  Type :

If  Type=A , then  Name  is a hostname and  Value  is the IP address for the hostname. Thus, a Type

A record provides the standard hostname-to-IP address mapping. As an example,

(relay1.bar.foo.com, 145.37.93.126, A)  is a Type A record.

If  Type=NS , then  Name  is a domain (such as  foo.com ) and  Value  is the hostname of an
authoritative DNS server that knows how to obtain the IP addresses for hosts in the domain. This

record is used to route DNS queries further along in the query chain. As an example,  (foo.com,

dns.foo.com, NS)  is a Type NS record.

If  Type=CNAME , then  Value  is a canonical hostname for the alias hostname  Name . This record

can provide querying hosts the canonical name for a hostname. As an example,  (foo.com,

relay1.bar.foo.com, CNAME)  is a CNAME record.

If  Type=MX , then  Value  is the canonical name of a mail server that has an alias hostname  Name .

As an example,  (foo.com, mail.bar.foo.com, MX)  is an MX record. MX records allow the
hostnames of mail servers to have simple aliases. Note that by using the MX record, a company can

have the same aliased name for its mail server and for one of its other servers (such as its Web

server). To obtain the canonical name for the mail server, a DNS client would query for an MX

record; to obtain the canonical name for the other server, the DNS client would query for the CNAME

record.

If a DNS server is authoritative for a particular hostname, then the DNS server will contain a Type A

record for the hostname. (Even if the DNS server is not authoritative, it may contain a Type A record in

its cache.) If a server is not authoritative for a hostname, then the server will contain a Type NS record

for the domain that includes the hostname; it will also contain a Type A record that provides the IP

address of the DNS server in the  Value  field of the NS record. As an example, suppose an edu TLD

server is not authoritative for the host  gaia.cs.umass.edu . Then this server will contain a record for

a domain that includes the host  gaia.cs.umass.edu , for example,  (umass.edu,

dns.umass.edu, NS) . The edu TLD server would also contain a Type A record, which maps the

DNS server  dns.umass.edu  to an IP address, for example,  (dns.umass.edu,

128.119.40.111, A) .

DNS Messages

Earlier in this section, we referred to DNS query and reply messages. These are the only two kinds of

DNS messages. Furthermore, both query and reply messages have the same format, as shown in

Figure 2.21.The semantics of the various fields in a DNS message are as follows:

The first 12 bytes is the header section, which has a number of fields. The first field is a 16-bit
number that identifies the query. This identifier is copied into the reply message to a query, allowing

the client to match received replies with sent queries. There are a number of flags in the flag field. A

1-bit query/reply flag indicates whether the message is a query (0) or a reply (1). A 1-bit authoritative

flag is

Figure 2.21 DNS message format

set in a reply message when a DNS server is an authoritative server for a queried name. A 1-bit

recursion-desired flag is set when a client (host or DNS server) desires that the DNS server perform

recursion when it doesn’t have the record. A 1-bit recursion-available field is set in a reply if the DNS

server supports recursion. In the header, there are also four number-of fields. These fields indicate

the number of occurrences of the four types of data sections that follow the header.

The question section contains information about the query that is being made. This section includes
(1) a name field that contains the name that is being queried, and (2) a type field that indicates the

type of question being asked about the name—for example, a host address associated with a name

(Type A) or the mail server for a name (Type MX).

In a reply from a DNS server, the answer section contains the resource records for the name that

was originally queried. Recall that in each resource record there is the  Type  (for example, A, NS,

CNAME, and MX), the  Value , and the  TTL . A reply can return multiple RRs in the answer, since a

hostname can have multiple IP addresses (for example, for replicated Web servers, as discussed

earlier in this section).

The authority section contains records of other authoritative servers.

The additional section contains other helpful records. For example, the answer field in a reply to an
MX query contains a resource record providing the canonical hostname of a mail server. The

additional section contains a Type A record providing the IP address for the canonical hostname of

the mail server.

How would you like to send a DNS query message directly from the host you’re working on to some

DNS server? This can easily be done with the nslookup program, which is available from most

Windows and UNIX platforms. For example, from a Windows host, open the Command Prompt and

invoke the nslookup program by simply typing “nslookup.” After invoking nslookup, you can send a DNS

query to any DNS server (root, TLD, or authoritative). After receiving the reply message from the DNS

server, nslookup will display the records included in the reply (in a human-readable format). As an

alternative to running nslookup from your own host, you can visit one of many Web sites that allow you

to remotely employ nslookup. (Just type “nslookup” into a search engine and you’ll be brought to one of

these sites.) The DNS Wireshark lab at the end of this chapter will allow you to explore the DNS in much

more detail.

Inserting Records into the DNS Database

The discussion above focused on how records are retrieved from the DNS database. You might be

wondering how records get into the database in the first place. Let’s look at how this is done in the

context of a specific example. Suppose you have just created an exciting new startup company called

Network Utopia. The first thing you’ll surely want to do is register the domain name

networkutopia.com  at a registrar. A registrar is a commercial entity that verifies the uniqueness of
the domain name, enters the domain name into the DNS database (as discussed below), and collects a

small fee from you for its services. Prior to 1999, a single registrar, Network Solutions, had a monopoly

on domain name registration for  com ,  net , and  org  domains. But now there are many registrars

competing for customers, and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

accredits the various registrars. A complete list of accredited registrars is available at  http://

www.internic.net .

When you register the domain name  networkutopia.com  with some registrar, you also need to
provide the registrar with the names and IP addresses of your primary and secondary authoritative DNS

servers. Suppose the names and IP addresses are  dns1.networkutopia.com ,

dns2.networkutopia.com ,  212.2.212.1,  and  212.212.212.2.  For each of these two
authoritative DNS servers, the registrar would then make sure that a Type NS and a Type A record are

entered into the TLD com servers. Specifically, for the primary authoritative server for

networkutopia.com , the registrar would insert the following two resource records into the DNS
system:

(networkutopia.com, dns1.networkutopia.com, NS)

(dns1.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.1, A)

You’ll also have to make sure that the Type A resource record for your Web server

www.networkutopia.com  and the Type MX resource record for your mail server

mail.networkutopia.com  are entered into your authoritative DNS

FOCUS ON SECURITY

DNS VULNERABILITIES

We have seen that DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure, with many

important services—including the Web and e-mail—simply incapable of functioning without it.

We therefore naturally ask, how can DNS be attacked? Is DNS a sitting duck, waiting to be

knocked out of service, while taking most Internet applications down with it?

The first type of attack that comes to mind is a DDoS bandwidth-flooding attack (see Section

1.6) against DNS servers. For example, an attacker could attempt to send to each DNS root
server a deluge of packets, so many that the majority of legitimate DNS queries never get

answered. Such a large-scale DDoS attack against DNS root servers actually took place on

October 21, 2002. In this attack, the attackers leveraged a botnet to send truck loads of ICMP

ping messages to each of the 13 DNS root IP addresses. (ICMP messages are discussed in

Section 5.6. For now, it suffices to know that ICMP packets are special types of IP datagrams.)
Fortunately, this large-scale attack caused minimal damage, having little or no impact on users’

Internet experience. The attackers did succeed at directing a deluge of packets at the root

servers. But many of the DNS root servers were protected by packet filters, configured to always

block all ICMP ping messages directed at the root servers. These protected servers were thus

spared and functioned as normal. Furthermore, most local DNS servers cache the IP addresses

of top-level-domain servers, allowing the query process to often bypass the DNS root servers.

A potentially more effective DDoS attack against DNS would be send a deluge of DNS queries

to top-level-domain servers, for example, to all the top-level-domain servers that handle the .com

domain. It would be harder to filter DNS queries directed to DNS servers; and top-level-domain

servers are not as easily bypassed as are root servers. But the severity of such an attack would

be partially mitigated by caching in local DNS servers.

DNS could potentially be attacked in other ways. In a man-in-the-middle attack, the attacker

intercepts queries from hosts and returns bogus replies. In the DNS poisoning attack, the

attacker sends bogus replies to a DNS server, tricking the server into accepting bogus records

into its cache. Either of these attacks could be used, for example, to redirect an unsuspecting

Web user to the attacker’s Web site. These attacks, however, are difficult to implement, as they

require intercepting packets or throttling servers [Skoudis 2006].

In summary, DNS has demonstrated itself to be surprisingly robust against attacks. To date,

there hasn’t been an attack that has successfully impeded the DNS service.

servers. (Until recently, the contents of each DNS server were configured statically, for example, from a

configuration file created by a system manager. More recently, an UPDATE option has been added to

the DNS protocol to allow data to be dynamically added or deleted from the database via DNS

messages. [RFC 2136] and [RFC 3007] specify DNS dynamic updates.)

Once all of these steps are completed, people will be able to visit your Web site and send e-mail to the

employees at your company. Let’s conclude our discussion of DNS by verifying that this statement is

true. This verification also helps to solidify what we have learned about DNS. Suppose Alice in Australia

wants to view the Web page  www.networkutopia.com . As discussed earlier, her host will first send

a DNS query to her local DNS server. The local DNS server will then contact a TLD  com  server. (The

local DNS server will also have to contact a root DNS server if the address of a TLD  com  server is not

cached.) This TLD server contains the Type NS and Type A resource records listed above, because the

registrar had these resource records inserted into all of the TLD com servers. The TLD com server

sends a reply to Alice’s local DNS server, with the reply containing the two resource records. The local

DNS server then sends a DNS query to  212.212.212.1 , asking for the Type A record corresponding

to  www.networkutopia.com . This record provides the IP address of the desired Web server, say,

212.212.71.4 , which the local DNS server passes back to Alice’s host. Alice’s browser can now

initiate a TCP connection to the host  212.212.71.4  and send an HTTP request over the connection.

Whew! There’s a lot more going on than what meets the eye when one surfs the Web!

2.5 Peer-to-Peer File Distribution

The applications described in this chapter thus far—including the Web, e-mail, and DNS—all employ

client-server architectures with significant reliance on always-on infrastructure servers. Recall from

Section 2.1.1 that with a P2P architecture, there is minimal (or no) reliance on always-on infrastructure
servers. Instead, pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers, communicate directly with each

other. The peers are not owned by a service provider, but are instead desktops and laptops controlled

by users.

In this section we consider a very natural P2P application, namely, distributing a large file from a single

server to a large number of hosts (called peers). The file might be a new version of the Linux operating

system, a software patch for an existing operating system or application, an MP3 music file, or an

MPEG video file. In client-server file distribution, the server must send a copy of the file to each of the

peers—placing an enormous burden on the server and consuming a large amount of server bandwidth.

In P2P file distribution, each peer can redistribute any portion of the file it has received to any other

peers, thereby assisting the server in the distribution process. As of 2016, the most popular P2P file

distribution protocol is BitTorrent. Originally developed by Bram Cohen, there are now many different

independent BitTorrent clients conforming to the BitTorrent protocol, just as there are a number of Web

browser clients that conform to the HTTP protocol. In this subsection, we first examine the self-

scalability of P2P architectures in the context of file distribution. We then describe BitTorrent in some

detail, highlighting its most important characteristics and features.

Scalability of P2P Architectures

To compare client-server architectures with peer-to-peer architectures, and illustrate the inherent self-

scalability of P2P, we now consider a simple quantitative model for distributing a file to a fixed set of

peers for both architecture types. As shown in Figure 2.22, the server and the peers are connected to

the Internet with access links. Denote the upload rate of the server’s access link by u , the upload rate of

s

the ith peer’s access link by u , and the download rate of the ith peer’s access link by d . Also denote the

size of the file to be distributed (in bits) by F and the number of peers that want to obtain a copy of the
file by N. The distribution time is the time it takes to get--------------------
